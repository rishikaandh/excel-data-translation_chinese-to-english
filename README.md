**The Python program employs the pandas library and leverages the Google Translate API through the googletrans library to translate both the column names and the data within columns of an Excel file from Chinese to English. The translation utilizes the Google Translate API for converting text from Chinese (zh-cn) to English (en). The translate_dataframe function is then employed to process the entire DataFrame, producing a new DataFrame (data_translated) with translated column names and corresponding translated data columns.**
